# Anki AI
**Project to control Anki Overdrive car using Machine Learning**

This repo is still very much in development. So do not expect proper finished code or much support at this stage. You are more than welcome to use it but at your own risk. 

The repo consists of 2 folders:
* **dashboard**: This is the frontend code, mainly SAPUI5
* **iOS**: This is the iOS app code. Still very much a skeleton app. The app is based on the repo from [jeff-1amstudios](https://github.com/jeff-1amstudios/anki-controller). So all kudos to him for integrating the Anki SDK onto Mac OS. We have only revamped it to iOS and made some adjustments to cater for our use case. On top of that we have added SCP iOS SDK look & feel. The framework files are not included so please get these yourself via the [SAP Store](https://store.sap.com/sap/cpa/ui/resources/store/html/SolutionDetails.html?pid=0000014485&catID=&pcntry=US&sap-language=EN&_cp_id=id-1523451138773-0).
